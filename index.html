    <h3 id="headline"> A timeline fo Alan Turing's life:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>1912</strong> -Alan Turing is born on June 23 in Paddington,London.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>1931</strong> - Turing studies mathematics at the University of Cambridge.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1934</strong> -After graduating from Kings College (University of Cambridge), Turing is elected to a fellowship at the university, researching probability theory.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>1936</strong> -Turing writes an original paper titled "On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entsceidungsproblem (Decision Problem)."" The theory was that there was an effective method for determining what type of system could prove which mathematical statements were probable within a given system, and which were not. Turing theorized that the problem has no solution, and that no system was effective for making decisions. Turing invents the  Universal Turing Machine, a machine that captures the fundamental principles of the digital computer. An American mathematical logician named Alonzo Church published a paper for the same problem, and got the same answer as Turing, but in a different way. The Church-Turing thesis  was significant for the evolution of the science of computing, due to the fact that it proves the limits of human computation.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>1938</strong> - Turing earns his Ph.D in mathematical logic from Princeton University.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>1939</strong> - Turing joins The Government Code and Cypher school. He and others develop the Bombe, a code breaking machine used to break the Enigma code. The Enigma was a cipher machine used to encrypt communications for the Axis Alliance (Germany, Italy, Japan).</li>
      <li>
        <strong>1950</strong> - Turing proposes the "Turing Test", a test that determines whether a computer is "thinking" or not. Turing would go on to be considered a founding father of artificial intelligence.</li> 
      <li>
        <strong>1954</strong> - On June 7, 1954, Alan Turing died. The cause of his death was suicide by cyanide poisoning.</li>
